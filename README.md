## About

This repository holds a Web Audio demonstration which examines a particular sound design process for creating
electronic bass sounds in the style of popular Drum n' Bass groups such as Noisia, Evol Intent, Trifonic, and KOAN
Sound. The blog post which accompanies it, linked above, tries to explain the intricacies of three major parts of
the process: phasing, waveshaping, and resampling, with the goal of answering the "why" kinds of questions behind
each step of this well-known process. 

"Why is resampling important?"

"Why does this distortion plugin sound better than my other distortion plugin?"

The details which answer these kinds of questions are often hidden behind the implementation of popular DAW 
software and VST plugins. But those same details become important for shaping a sound when working with a 
lower-level interface such as the Web Audio API, and, frankly, are just really interesting. This project attempts
to illuminate such details, at least from the perspective of a musician with little formal DSP training.
